I like to ask business questions, source and analyze the relevant data, and visualize my insights for my teammates to act on. Iâ€™m also capable of using predictive modelling to drive value.

In my latest role, I analyzed logistics data and surfaced insights to drive successful business decisions. This helped the organization reduce congestion and made spending on transportation more effective.

I have a Postgraduate Certificate and Advanced Diploma in Statistics. My thesis focused on curbing armed robberies in Etsako West Local Government, Nigeria. My team and I built a time-series model that forecasted future armed robberies. Our analysis and model were expanded on with an accompanying report that detailed possible measures for reducing the rate of armed robberies and was provided to the Police and Local Government.
